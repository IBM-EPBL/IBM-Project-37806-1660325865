          Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries
          Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they
          live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large
          language ocean.
        </p>
        <p>
          A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with
          the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which
          roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.
        </p>

        I always felt like I could do anything. That’s the main thing people are
        controlled by! Thoughts- their perception of themselves! They're slowed
        down by their perception of themselves. If you're taught you can’t do
        anything, you won’t do anything. I was taught I could do everything.
        <br /><br />
        As we live, our hearts turn colder. Cause pain is what we go through as
        we become older. We get insulted by others, lose trust for those others.
        We get back stabbed by friends. It becomes harder for us to give others
        a hand. We get our heart broken by people we love, even that we give
        them all we have. Then we lose family over time. What else could rust
        the heart more over time? Blackgold.
        <br /><br />

        We’re not always in the position that we want to be at. We’re constantly
        growing. We’re constantly making mistakes. We’re constantly trying to
        express ourselves and actualize our dreams. If you have the opportunity
        to play this game of life you need to appreciate every moment. A lot of
        people don’t appreciate the moment until it’s passed.
        <br /><br />

        There’s nothing I really wanted to do in life that I wasn’t able to get
        good at. That’s my skill. I’m not really specifically talented at
        anything except for the ability to learn. That’s what I do. That’s what
        I’m here for. Don’t be afraid to be wrong because you can’t learn
        anything from a compliment.
        <br /><br />

        It really matters and then like it really doesn’t matter. What matters
        is the people who are sparked by it. And the people who are like
        offended by it, it doesn’t matter. Because it's about motivating the
        doers. Because I’m here to follow my dreams and inspire other people to
        follow their dreams, too.
